## 💡 Start Your Own Project!

We encourage members to propose new projects!  
If you have an idea that aligns with the mission of ViewsTech, follow these steps:

1. Open an issue using the **Project Proposal Template**.
2. Describe the project idea, required skills, and expected outcomes.
3. Get approval from community moderators.
4. Once approved, a dedicated repository and Discord channel will be created.

> **Note**: Projects with strong potential may be selected for commercialization and profit-sharing within the community.  
> See our [README](README.md) for details.

## 🛠️ Project Guidelines
- All projects must be open-source by default (unless selected for commercialization).
- Collaborate respectfully with your team.
